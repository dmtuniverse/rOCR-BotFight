# rOCR-BotFight

I created a new sub because this one is not moderated and has a bot running wild. Seems multiple people, including myself, have requested moderator status to clean it up, but requests fall on deaf ears.
Feel free to join and post :)
I will be adding content myself over the coming days.

Edit: wtf is with this bot? Seems to bulk comment in response to view count as far as I can tell, mfer blowing up my notifications. I don't get the point of it. Anyone have any insight?  
edit2; mfer bulk comments every time I edit xD  
edit3; interesting. I wonder if the bot can be kept busy if I write a bot to edit posts.  
edit4; never even looked at reddit's API docs. Mean time I'm just editing for the fun of it.  
edit5; if I can spam edits to keep the bot spamming, would Reddit even flag the activity?  
edit6; surely if my bot keeps the sub bot going into 100k's of comments in a short space of time, that has to be worthy of flagging right?  
edit7; I'm just going to add a bunch of edits here manually to make sure the bot doesnt have some kind of rate limit on the low end. I'll grab another beer and start reading reddit api docs shortly.

edit21; alright I need to go grab some more beer from the shop. Reddit docs next..  
edit22; 452 unread notifications xD  
edit23; there is a .NET library for Reddit. Awesome! https://github.com/sirkris/Reddit.NET  
edit24; 20 comments exactly from my last edit. Should have paid more attention to frequency before now.  
edit25; that's another 20 comments. Will have to make a new post to see what the ramp is on new posts as I'm almost sure it did more than 20 to start with. A task for later.  
edit26; FAO WHOEVER OWNS THIS BOT: please do not delete this post if you see it, or at least give me fair warning. This is now an educational endeavor for me and I want to share my journey.  
edit27; this post is now being mirrored at https://github.com/dmtuniverse/rOCR-BotFight  
edit28; I have no idea if anyone has commented on this post. If you have and it's not upvoted, PM me a link and I'll upvote which will hopefully put it at the top. If not I'll add it to the OP.
